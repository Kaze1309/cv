                <h3>Tryna be good at PC Gaming</h3>
                <p>I am investing my time right now about learning most important aspect of gaming that of acquiring the
                    skills and enjoying the journey.It does take a lot of grinding to make a name for yourself
                    in this particular industry, But I will keey trying. Right now I am trying to go pro in the 
                    Riot's new FPS Valorant. The competition here is tough but I will keep grinding.</p>
            </div>

                <img class="primary-skill" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1903/1903172.png" alt="study">
                <h3>Looks like have to study as well</h3>
                <p>So my primary objective has to be focus on my studies and try to enjoy this other aspect of my life
                    as well. I do like the Mathematics at the college very much. Even if I do not get successful at the CS
                    degree I am doing I still can become a Mathematics Professor. Solving complext algebra, doing degree-3
                    differentiations has been my favourite things during this journey of mine. Again, College is tough
                    but I will keep trying until I succeed.</p>
